\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
The teaching objectives for this week are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item To identify existing projects for undergraduate level in the AI domain.
\item To get awareness of the effort expected for the laboratory activity by browsing past projects at TUCN and other universities.
\item To get used with the technical instrumentation used during this semester. 
%That is: i) assigning the AI tool, ii) set your latex environment for writing your final report.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
My personal objectives for this class are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item At the beginning of each class, please write what do you expect to learn/achieve/understand/develop during the following two hours.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}


An ideal project should be one that demonstrates some creativity, 
attempts to answer an interesting research question, 
or offers an interesting AI solution to a real scenario.

\section{AI undergraduate projects}
This section aims to provide you starting ideas on student AI projects.
Browse the following resources:  
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \href{http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/projektforslag/ai_projects.pdf}{Project proposals in AI} at Roskilde University, Denmark
\item \href{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./10701/projects.html}{Machine learning project} suggestions at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10701/project.html)

\href{http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-871-knowledge-based-applications-systems-spring-2005/projects/}{MITOpenCoursware}
\end{enumerate}

The projects are intended to let you look in depth at some area of artificial intelligence 
that may only be covered briefly in class or AIMA. 
You can see the AI lab as an opportunity for you to explore an interesting problem of your choice in the context of a real-world scenario.
Hence, we encourage you to do some original research in the AI domain that is of interest to you. 
To give you an idea, about how your fellows work as students, take a look at the examples below:

Here is a list of project ideas:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item A machine learning approach for identifying patterns at Eurovision musical competition. 
\item Performance comparison of AI algorithms in the Wumpus world.
\item A multi-agent system for playing the board game Risk. Assess the
relative strength of each player and the strategic value of each country. 
\item Intersection situation awareness and normative reasoning.
\item Summarize an article written in wikipedia or other technical text.
\item Checking if a small text is entailed by a larger text.
\item Extracting arguments in a persuasive or legal text.
\item A knowledge-based computer purchasing adviser.
\item Build an ontology from a collection of documents using machine learning.
\item Legal assistant in case of divorces. Splitting marital property between spouse.
\item Advisor for installing a wind turbine.

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
The teaching objectives for this week are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item To have a clear description of what you intend to develop.
\item To point to specific resources (datasets, knowledge bases, external tools) 
that support the development of your idea and which minimise the risk of failure.

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
My personal objectives for this class are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \hline
 \item \hline
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}


Realistic and original scenarious are encouraged. 
Well known toy problems (salesmen, map coloring, logistic planning, wumpus, sudoku, queens, missionaires and canibals, etc.) do not worth much for your grade. 
Your scenario should be realistic and should be business oriented. 
Note that the focus is both on programming and on modelling the reality into a formal representation.

Consider answering to the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What will your system do?
\item Which is the scope of coverage your system aims for?
\item What will be the input of your program?
\item What will be the output of your program?
\item What will be the knowledge of your system?
\item Which would be the narrative description of running scenario(s)?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[What will system do]
 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Scope of the program]
 
\end{example}


\section{Narrative description}
Textual description of your scenario.

\section{Specifications}
List of specifications.

\section{Top level design of the scenario}
Technical description of your scenario. 
In some cases, you may provide a figure with the architecture of the system. 


\section{Knowledge acquisition}

\paragraph{How do represent knowledge?} 
Your system relies on a knowledge base.
You have to describe how do you represent this knowledge.
You might choose between different logics: 
propositional logic, first order logic, modal logics, description logics, epistemic logics, 
temporal logics, and so on. 

\paragraph{Where are you getting the required knowledge/data}
Point towards the knowledge bases that you plan to exploit. 
The existence of these sources are required to prove that your approach is realistic.

Examples of knowledge sources include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data sets: i.e., https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html 
\item Statistics: i.e., http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat 
\item Ontology repositories 
\end{itemize}



If you will be using books give their reference. 
If you hope to exploit people give their names.
If you aim to use data sources or knowledge repositories list them and be sure that you have 
access to the needed knowledge. Indicate what you have accomplished so far in knowledge acquisition. 



\section{Related work}
You have to identify articles or conference papers relevant to your scenario.

Browse online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar. 

Obtain the .bib file of each article that you will rely on. 
Cite and very briefly describe the main idea of the papers that you have read.

Save the most relevant related papers in a local directory.

The following is an example of \texttt{bib} file:

\begin{verbatim}
 @article{bench-capon:argumentation-in-ai,
 author = {Bench-Capon, Trevor J. M.  and Dunne, Paul E. },
 title = {{A}rgumentation in {A}rtificial {I}ntelligence},
 journal = {Artificial Intelligence},
 volume = {171},
 number = {10-15},
 year = {2007},
 issn = {0004-3702},
 pages = {619--641},
 doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2007.05.001},
 publisher = {Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd.},
 address = {Essex, UK}
}
\end{verbatim}

Don't forget to include the above structure in your .bib file.

\chapter{Implementation details ($W_9$)}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20]

\section{Common bad practice in AI undergraduate projects}

\paragraph{The over-estimated AI programmer.} $ $

{\it Bad practice}: Excepting few genial students, you tend to overestimate your AI-programming abilities. 
That is, you start to write a large amount of code. (Here large might be 20 lines).
When testing it, nothing run. 
You start to debug a line or to remove it.
Your program will not run this time too. 
You remove or comment another line. 
And so on, until you have a single line of code.
If you are lucky, that could run. 
But you lose a lot of time in this enterprise.

{\it Solution}: In the early stage of writing code, write a line of code and test it. 
If it works, write another line and test it. 
And so on. 
That is, you are exploiting the interactive environments provided by 
AI tools or languages like LISP and PROLOG.
You should hold your horses and 
have the most possible skeptical attitude towards your code.  
As you get experience, your will be noticing that writing 
AI-declarative code is more effective than procedural one.  


\paragraph{The eyewash bug.} $ $
{\it Bad practice}: You spend most of your programming time to develop a GUI for your AI-system. 
Don't bother. I am sympathetic with Sania Twain's view on GUIs: "You don't impress me much".
Such things are indeed important in computer science, but not relevant in this AI class.


%\paragraph{The stucker bug} 

\paragraph{The not-organised student.}
You are not organised, if something like this will happen to you:
\begin{itemize}
 \item You do not find your project and yield "Someone removed my project!". 
Most of the time your are logged with a different user as usual. 
Check this with \texttt{who am i}. 
This is not a rhetorical question, but a Linux command.
\item You are working in a different directory. 
Type \texttt{pwd} and \texttt{ls} to check that your executables are indeed in the current working directory.
If you have been lasy to set your PATH variable, you might just forgot to type \texttt{./} 
for executing the command in the current directory.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Tool expressivity ($W_{10}$)}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
The teaching objectives for this week are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Describe each technical instrumentation provided 
by the tool that was enacted in your implementation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20]

\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}


%For instance:
%{\it "Racer offers also the capability to use {\it rules}. 
%he code in Fig.~\ref{fig:rules} illustrates my rule used to create instances of type student."}


\chapter{Graph and experiments ($W_{11}$)}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
The objectives for this week are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item To describe and interpret each experiment that you have performed
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

The teaching objectives for this week are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item To compare your results to related work.
\item To discuss the advantages and limitations of your solution.
\item To deliver a professional documentation of your work.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\end{mdframed}


Identify and describe other solutions for solving the same scenario like yours.
For instance: \cite{chesnevar:Survey2000}

\section{Related approaches}

\section{Advantages and limitations of your solution}


\section{Possible extensions of the current work}

From your final report, remove the text/examples/algorithms/rules/bibliographic references/etc - keep only your notes. If the documentation does not meet minimum standard for lisability and scientific discourse, it will be classified by the furious teaching assistant as unacceptable and therefore rejected.


\chapter{Results dissemination ($W_{13}$)}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
The teaching objectives for this week are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To practice public presentation.
\item To get used with the beamer template for making scientific presentations

\chapter{Your original code}

This section should contain only code developed by you, without any line re-used from other sources. 
This section helps me to correctly evaluate your amount of work and results obtained. 
Including in this section any line of code taken from someone else leads to failure of IS class this year.
